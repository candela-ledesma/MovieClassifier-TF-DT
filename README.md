# MovieClassifier-TF-DT

## Project 2 - Artificial Intelligence 2024 ðŸ¤–

---

## Introduction

This project aims to classify movies using machine learning techniques. Two different models have been implemented: a Decision Tree and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The data has been preprocessed and feature adjustments have been made to improve model accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/candela-ledesma/MovieClassifier-TF-DT.git
   cd MovieClassifier-TF-DT
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure to manually add the files `movies_train.csv` and `movies_test.csv` to the project directory for proper functionality.

2. Open and run the notebook `IA.ipynb` to train and evaluate the models.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading and Analysis**: Import necessary libraries and load datasets.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and transform the data for analysis.
- **Decision Tree Development**: Implement and evaluate the Decision Tree model.
- **Artificial Neural Network Development**: Implement and evaluate the Artificial Neural Network model.

## Results

The prediction results are saved in a CSV file called `test_with_predictions.csv`.
